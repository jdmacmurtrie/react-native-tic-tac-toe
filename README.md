This is my first crack at a react-native app.  It's bootstrapped with `create-react-native-app`, and can be run with `expo`.

## Install

```js
// First, make sure you have expo CLI installed:
$ npm install -g expo-cli

// Then, in the project directory:
$ npm i && expo start
```

If you haven't downloaded the `expo` app on your phone, do so from the app store.  Then you'll be able to scan the QR code that appears in the terminal after `expo start`.

(Disclaimer: I've only been able to test this on android so far, so `expo` might/probably will run differently...)
